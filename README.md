# Learning Git Basics

**What I learned about Git:**  
1. Git helps track changes in files.  
2. GitHub stores Git projects online.  
3. Git allows collaboration and version control.
**Real-life example of Git usage in a team:**
When multiple developers work on the same project, Git helps by allowing each person to work on their own copy of the code. For example, one person can work on fixing bugs while another adds new features. Git keeps track of all changes and helps merge them safely without losing anyone’s work.

**Git Branches – Explanation:**

A branch in Git is a separate copy of the code where changes can be made without affecting the main codebase.

Teams use branches so multiple people can work on different features at the same time without disturbing each other’s work.

For example, when adding a new login feature, a developer creates a feature branch to work on it safely before merging it into the main branch.
